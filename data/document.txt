The two major Python versions are Python 2 and Python 3, which are not completely backward-compatible. The Python 2 language was officially discontinued in 2020. Python 3 is the current and future of the language.

Common use cases for Python include web development (using frameworks like Django and Flask), data science (with libraries like pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn), machine learning (with TensorFlow and PyTorch), and scripting/automation.

Python's ecosystem is vast, with the Python Package Index (PyPI) hosting hundreds of thousands of third-party packages. Developers use the `pip` package manager to easily install and manage these libraries, extending Python's capabilities for specific tasks. To manage dependencies for different projects, developers often use virtual environments, created via the `venv` module, which isolate project-specific packages from the global Python installation.

A core principle of Python is that everything is an object, including numbers, strings, and functions. This consistent object model contributes to the language's flexibility and power, fully supporting the object-oriented programming paradigm with features like classes, inheritance, and polymorphism.

The language's philosophy is famously summarized in "The Zen of Python" (which can be viewed by typing `import this` into a Python interpreter). It includes aphorisms like "Beautiful is better than ugly," "Explicit is better than implicit," and "Simple is better than complex," which guide developers in writing clean, readable, and maintainable code.
